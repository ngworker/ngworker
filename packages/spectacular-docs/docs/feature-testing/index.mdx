Spectacular's feature testing API configures the Angular testing module and sets
up a test harness for a routed Angular feature. It contains a few companion
services that wrap Angular's built-in navigation services, but adjusted to the
Angular feature under test.

The feature test harness is used to test standalone feature routes, routed
feature modules, and shell modules.

## Feature tests

The purpose of feature tests is to test a part of our application _as a user_,
that is by interacting with the DOM both to trigger side effects and assert
their observable outcome from a user perspective.

Spectacular does not provide an API for interacting with the DOM. We can use
Angular's testing APIs such as debug elements for this. Alternatively, we
[combine Spectacular with Angular Testing Library](feature-testing/angular-testing-library)
or Angular component harnesses.

The scope of a feature test is a routed Angular module or standalone routes.
They can contain multiple routed components, multiple routing components, route
guards, route resolvers, and multiple services in addition to the components and
the directives, components, and pipes used in their component template.

A feature test uses real routing services and data structures such as:

- The `Router` service
- The `Location` service
- `ActivatedRoute` services
- `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`
- `Route`
- `RouterStateSnapshot`
- `UrlTree`

In a single test case, it's possible to navigate around the entire Angular
feature. We can perform full user flows if it makes sense or we can assert one
step at a time without having to worry about setting up complex test doubles for
routing and navigation.

The feature testing harness provides convenience wrappers for the `Location` and
`Router` services, namely the
[`SpectacularFeatureLocation`](api/classes/spectacularfeaturelocation) and
[`SpectacularFeatureRouter`](api/classes/spectacularfeaturerouter) services,
respectively. They allow to navigate relatively to the root feature route and
query for the activated route path relative to the root feature route. The tilde
(`~`) character denotes a feature-relative route path.

## Setting up an Angular feature integration test with Spectacular

Spectacular's feature testing API takes care of tedious and error-prone test
setup. Notice in the following code snippet how we pass the routed feature under
test as well as the route path used to load it in our application:

```ts {14,16}
import {
  createFeatureHarness,
  SpectacularFeatureHarness,
} from '@ngworker/spectacular';
import {
  crisisCenterPath,
  crisisCenterRoutes,
  CrisisService,
} from '@tour-of-heroes/crisis-center';

describe('Tour of Heroes: Crisis center integration tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    harness = createFeatureHarness({
      featurePath: crisisCenterPath,
      routes: [
        { path: crisisCenterPath, loadChildren: () => crisisCenterRoutes },
      ],
    });

    crisisService = harness.inject(CrisisService);
  });

  let crisisService: CrisisService;
  let harness: SpectacularFeatureHarness;
});
```

The `createFeatureHarness` function takes care of all the test setup steps we
reviewed in the previous section to the point that there's no need to import
from any Angular package.

Spectacular is straight to the point: We tell it the scope of what we're
testing, in this case the crisis center feature. Spectacular takes care of the
test setup behind the scenes so that we can focus on writing tests.

## Testing a complete user flow with Spectacular

Spectacular doesn't offer an API for interacting with or inspecting the DOM. To
make this easier,
[combine Spectacular with Angular Testing Library](./angular-testing-library.mdx)
or Angular component harnesses.

While Spectacular does not offer APIs for interacting with or inspecting the
DOM, it does, however, takes care of certain boilerplate code that shows up in
common scenarios.

When comparing a feature test using Spectacular to
[a feature test using Angular testbed](./angular-testbed.mdx#reviewing-a-feature-test-using-the-angular-testbed),
we notice a few convenience APIs in use:

```ts
describe('Editing a crisis', () => {
  it('navigates to the crisis center home with the crisis selected when the change is saved', async () => {
    const [aCrisis] = crisisService.getCrises().value;
    await harness.router.navigate(['~', aCrisis.id]); // [1] [2]
    const inputElement: HTMLInputElement =
      harness.rootFixture.debugElement.query(By.css('input')).nativeElement;
    const saveButtonElement: HTMLButtonElement =
      harness.rootFixture.debugElement
        .queryAll(By.css('button'))
        .map(button => button.nativeElement)
        .find(
          (buttonElement: HTMLButtonElement) =>
            buttonElement.textContent?.trim() === 'Save'
        );
    const newCrisisName = 'Global climate crisis';

    inputElement.value = newCrisisName;
    inputElement.dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
    saveButtonElement.click();
    await harness.rootFixture.whenStable();

    const welcomeText: HTMLElement = harness.rootFixture.debugElement.query(
      By.css('p')
    ).nativeElement;
    const selectedCrisis: HTMLElement = harness.rootFixture.debugElement.query(
      By.css('.selected')
    ).nativeElement;
    expect(welcomeText.textContent).toBe('Welcome to the Crisis Center');
    expect(selectedCrisis.textContent?.trim()).toBe(
      `${aCrisis.id}${newCrisisName}`
    );
    expect(harness.location.path()).toBe(`~/;id=${aCrisis.id};foo=foo`); // [3]
  });
});
```

1. We don't have to navigate in the context of an NgZone.
2. When navigating, we use the feature-relative route symbol (`~`) instead of
   repeating the feature route path.
3. When inspecting the application path, we use the feature-relative route
   symbol (`~`) instead of repeating the feature route path.

A feature harness offers feature-aware router and location services in its
`router` and `location` properties. They are synchronized with Angular's
corresponding services which they wrap.

## Spectacular benefits

In this page, we saw how to set up a testing root component, register a routed
feature module with the Angular testing module, initialize feature navigation,
navigate to a feature route, interact with the DOM, and inspect the application
path.

We first explored the intricate setup needed for a feature test when using the
Angular testbed. Afterwards, we compared that to the lightweight setup offered
by Spectacular's feature testing API.

Finally, we saw how Spectacular adds convenience APIs to remove common
boilerplate from feature tests.

Spectacular offers:

- Lightweight, reusable test setup for tests scoped to a routed feature module
- Performing multi-step feature tests involving multiple routed components
- Feature-aware location and router services reducing feature test boilerplate
- Tests exercising an entire Angular feature without needing a host application
- Feature tests that are faster than end-to-end tests
- The flexibility to access or replace Angular services as needed

You might have noticed that Spectacular doesn't have APIs for interacting with
or inspecting our application's DOM. However, Spectacular's feature testing API
was built with compatibility in mind. Spectacular can be
[integrated with Angular Testing Library](feature-testing/angular-testing-library)
or Angular component test harnesses.

by Spectacular's feature testing API.
