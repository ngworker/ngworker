title: Feature Testing API

Spectacular's feature testing API configures the Angular testing module and sets
up a test harness for a routed Angular feature module. It contains a few
companion services that wrap Angular's built-in navigation services, but
adjusted to the Angular feature module under test.

The feature test harness is used to test routed feature modules and shell
modules.
