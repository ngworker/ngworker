Spectacular is an integration testing library for Angular applications and libraries. Spectacular offers specialized test harnesses making it more convenient to test parts of Angular projects that are usually hard to test.

## Spectacular benefits

High-confidence integration tests. This is the power of Spectacular. Specialized test harnesses make it easier to create integration tests for Angular-specific software artifacts.

Spectacular offers the speed and the flexibility of the Angular testbed without the framework and testbed boilerplate. Spectacular's test harnesses run our Angular-specific software artifacts in an environment as reasonably close to a real Angular application as possible.

It's worth mentioning that Spectacular is testing framework-agnostic. It works with all test runners and testing frameworks as long as they support the Angular testbed.

Spectacular offers the following testing APIs:

- [Application testing](./application-testing)
- [Feature testing](./feature-testing)
- [Pipe testing](./pipe-testing)
